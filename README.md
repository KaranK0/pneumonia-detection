# Pneumonia detection using CNN
The objective of this project is to develop a custom CNN architecture for accurate and automated detection of pneumonia from chest X-rays, and deploy it on a web app using the Flask framework.

# Requirements
You will need Python 3 with Tensorflow, keras, numpy and flask.

## Key conclusions from our work include:
<ul>
  <li>Our results showed that the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 72.11% on the test dataset.</li>
  <li>There is a need for larger and more diverse datasets to improve the generalizability of automated pneumonia detection models.</li>
  <li>The proposed model has the potential to aid healthcare professionals in the early detection and treatment of pneumonia, especially in resource-limited settings.</li>
</ul>

## Potential future work in this project could include:
<ul>
  <li>This model can be improved massively with higher-resolution images, better data sampling, no leakage between training and testing, better target variables and normalization.</li>
  <li>The development of ensemble models that combine multiple approaches for pneumonia detection, to improve overall accuracy and robustness.
</li>
</ul>
